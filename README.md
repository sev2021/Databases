Conceptual Data Model:  

A conceptual data model incudes entities and relationships between these entities.

An entity is an example of real world object like concert Ticket or Venue. Strong entity is a type of entity that is not dependant of other entities, and examples of strong entities can be Venue or Client. Weak entity is an entity type that can't exist without other entities like Sale can't exist without Client, Ticket can't exist without Event.

Relationship is an association or a dependency between two entities. The conceptual data model represents the most important entities and their relationships. It does not specify the attributes or primary key. In overall, the conceptual data model represents the essential entities and the relationships among the entities. In other words, it does not provide information like logical or physical data models.
